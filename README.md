**Donation Goal**  
Donation goal update program. Uses Node.js and electron.js to update a local web page and interface with OBS to display a donation goal overlay.

**NOTE**  
This repository isn't maintained. I keep this maintained on a private repository on Bitbucket. This one is almost explicitly here to show potential employers that I do write code occasionally in my spare time.
